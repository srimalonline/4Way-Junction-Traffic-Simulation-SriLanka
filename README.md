# 4-Way Junction Traffic Simulation (Sri Lanka) — Enhanced Version

This project is an enhanced version of the original [NetLogo community model](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/4Way-Junction-Traffic-Simulation-SriLanka), designed to simulate traffic flow at a four-way junction under Sri Lankan road conditions. The updated model introduces advanced routing logic and dynamic traffic density control for more realistic and flexible simulations.

## New Features

- **Route Combination Logic**  
  Integrated all 7 possible route combinations to support predictive routing and improve traffic realism.

- **Minimum Density Manipulation**  
  Added controls to adjust minimum traffic density thresholds, allowing for congestion management and adaptive flow strategies.

## Model Overview

The simulation uses agent-based modeling to represent vehicles and traffic lights at a four-way intersection. Key components include:

- Traffic lights with adjustable timing cycles.
- Vehicles that respond to signals and navigate based on directional headings.
- Real-time metrics for traffic density, waiting time, and deadlock detection.
- Predictive routing based on route combinations and density thresholds.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Click `Setup` to initialize the simulation.
2. **Run**: Click `Go` to start the simulation.
3. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - Use sliders to modify traffic light cycles, vehicle count, and speed.
   - Input peak/off-peak timings.
   - Toggle route prediction and density manipulation features.

## Observations

- Evaluate how route prediction affects congestion and flow.
- Monitor deadlock detection and resolution.
- Analyze vehicle behavior under different traffic light timings.
- Observe the impact of density manipulation on traffic efficiency.

## Suggested Experiments

- Simulate peak vs. off-peak traffic conditions.
- Test various route combinations and density thresholds.
- Compare performance with and without predictive routing.
- Adjust traffic light cycles to optimize flow.

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-junction network simulation.
- Integration with real-time traffic data.
- Inclusion of pedestrian and public transport agents.
- Modeling of overtaking and lane-changing behavior.
